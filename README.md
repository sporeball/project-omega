# project OMEGA
a tiny game console, powered by the Adafruit METRO Mini

### what is project OMEGA?
project OMEGA (**O**riginal **ME**TRO-based **G**ame **A**pparatus) is my very first Arduino project. in contrast to its name, it's a tiny game console &mdash; powered by the [Adafruit METRO Mini](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2590) and an 8x8 LED matrix.

this is still very much a work-in-progress, with more Arduino sketches and a Fritzing diagram coming soon.
