# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation of Project OMEGA, [sporeball](https://github.com/sporeball)'s first Arduino project!

## About Project OMEGA

Contrary to its name, Project OMEGA is a tiny game console, powered by the [Adafruit METRO Mini](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2590) and an 8x8 LED matrix. The hope is that this minimal setup can result in a board that's easy to write code for and fun to play games with.

All of the code driving Project OMEGA, as well as this documentation, is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sporeball/project-omega)! Anyone is welcome to contribute.

## Getting started

Check out the [getting started](getting-started.md) tutorial for a step-by-step guide to writing your first game!

Alternatively, dive straight into the [API reference](api-reference.md) to learn about everything you can do with Project OMEGA.
